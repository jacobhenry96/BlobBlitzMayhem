# BlobBlitzMayhem
Blob Blitz Mayhem is a game where you are a ninja and dodge the ever increasing wave of blobs trying to overwhelm you. It is very easy to download and play if you have python installed on your computer. It is made using pygame and my biggest challenges were the collision system within the game between blobs and the ninja and setting up the GUI. 
I definetly plan on making updates and improvements to this game in the future and look forward to making it more interesting and playable.
